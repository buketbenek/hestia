"""
Container classes for C++ types.

This includes everything that has an own documentation:
    * namespaces
    * classes
    * structs
    * functions
    * parameters
    * enums
    * member variables

The package consists of two modules:
    * parameters -  parameters for functions and enums and containers for them
    * compounds  -  everything from the list above, that is not a parameter 
                    of some sort
